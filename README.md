# Vs Metal Sonic in Sonic 3 A.I.R
Adds Metal Sonic as a boss fight to Sonic 3 Angel Island Revisited.

There is no explanation as to why Metal Sonic is here, but that will come when my level mod releases (eventually).
He replaces Death Ball in DEZ2, because Death Ball is annoying.
There are changes to the arena, such as the removal of gravity flipping teleporters (This is because they aren't a mechanic used in the fight.)
